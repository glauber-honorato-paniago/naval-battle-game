# Naval Battle Game
This is a naval battle game developed in Python. The player's objective is to discover the positions of enemy ships on a 7x7 grid. Each position is represented by a row and a column, where the player must enter the correct values to attack the enemy ships.

# How to Play
1. Upon starting the game, you will see an empty grid and some menu options.
2. To make a move, enter the desired row and column separated by a space.
3. If the selected position contains an enemy ship, an "x" will be displayed on the grid. Otherwise, a "0" will be displayed.
4. The game will continue until you run out of available moves or until all enemy ships are destroyed.
5. At the end of the game, you will have the option to start a new game or quit.
   
# Commands
During the game, you can use the following commands:

  Type m to access the menu at any time.
  Type n to start a new game.
  Type e to quit the game.
  
# Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The game was developed and tested using Python 3.

# Notes
  The game displays the player's grid, remaining moves, and the remaining positions divisible by 5 (for debugging purposes only).
  The game was developed to be run in a console/terminal environment.
  
Enjoy playing Naval Battle!
